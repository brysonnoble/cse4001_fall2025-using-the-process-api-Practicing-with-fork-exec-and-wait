# Assignment: Practicing the Process API
Practicing with fork, exec, wait. 

### Overview

In this assignment, you will practice using the Process API to create processes and run programs under Linux. The goal is to gain hands-on experience with system calls related to process management. Specifically, you will practice using the unix process API functions 'fork()', 'exec()', 'wait()', and 'exit()'. 

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This is not an OS/161 assignment. You will complete it directly on Linux. 

Use the Linux in your CSE4001 container. If you are using macOS, you may use the Terminal (you may need to install development tools with C/C++ compilers).

### Questions
1. Write a program that calls `fork()`. Before calling `fork()`, have the main process access a variable (e.g., x) and set its value to something (e.g., 100). What value is the variable in the child process? What happens to the variable when both the child and parent change the value of x?


```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>

int main() {
    int x = 100;
    printf("Before fork, x = %d\n", x);

    pid_t pid = fork();
    if (pid == 0) {
        // Child process
        printf("Child: x = %d\n", x);
        x = 200;
        printf("Child changed x to %d\n", x);
    } else {
        // Parent process
        printf("Parent: x = %d\n", x);
        x = 300;
        printf("Parent changed x to %d\n", x);
    }

    return 0;
} 
```


2. Write a program that opens a file (with the `open()` system call) and then calls `fork()` to create a new process. Can both the child and parent access the file descriptor returned by `open()`? What happens when they are writing to the file concurrently, i.e., at the same time?

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    int fd = open("test.txt", O_CREAT | O_WRONLY | O_TRUNC, 0644);
    if (fd < 0) {
        perror("open");
        return 1;
    }

    pid_t pid = fork();
    if (pid == 0) {
        write(fd, "Child writing\n", strlen("Child writing\n"));
    } else {
        write(fd, "Parent writing\n", strlen("Parent writing\n"));
    }

    close(fd);
    return 0;
} 
```

3. Write another program using `fork()`.The child process should print ‚Äúhello‚Äù; the parent process should print ‚Äúgoodbye‚Äù. You should try to ensure that the child process always prints first; can you do this without calling `wait()` in the parent?

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    pid_t pid = fork();

    if (pid == 0) {
        printf("hello\n");
    } else {
        usleep(1000); 
        printf("goodbye\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```


4. Write a program that calls `fork()` and then calls some form of `exec()` to run the program `/bin/ls`. See if you can try all of the variants of `exec()`, including (on Linux) `execl()`, `execle()`, `execlp()`, `execv()`, `execvp()`, and `execvpe()`. Why do you think there are so many variants of the same basic call?

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    pid_t pid = fork();
    if (pid == 0) {
        execl("/bin/ls", "ls", "-l", NULL);
        // execlp("ls", "ls", "-l", NULL);
        // execv("/bin/ls", (char *[]){"ls", "-l", NULL});
        // execvp("ls", (char *[]){"ls", "-l", NULL});
        perror("exec failed");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

5. Now write a program that uses `wait()` to wait for the child process to finish in the parent. What does `wait()` return? What happens if you use `wait()` in the child?

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>

int main() {
    pid_t pid = fork();
    if (pid == 0) {
        printf("Child running\n");
    } else {
        int status;
        pid_t child_pid = wait(&status);
        printf("Parent: child %d finished with status %d\n", child_pid, status);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

6. Write a slight modification of the previous program, this time using `waitpid()` instead of `wait()`. When would `waitpid()` be useful?

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>

int main() {
    pid_t pid = fork();
    if (pid == 0) {
        printf("Child running\n");
        sleep(2);
    } else {
        int status;
        waitpid(pid, &status, 0);
        printf("Parent waited for child %d\n", pid);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

7. Write a program that creates a child process, and then in the child closes standard output (`STDOUT FILENO`). What happens if the child calls `printf()` to print some output after closing the descriptor?

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    pid_t pid = fork();
    if (pid == 0) {
        close(STDOUT_FILENO);
        printf("This will not be printed!\n");
    } else {
        printf("Parent still prints normally.\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```
